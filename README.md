# Ours.Visual-Novel

Ours.Visual-Novel is a heartfelt visual novel that blends an emotionally driven story with a variety of mini-games. The game explores friendship, identity, and the mysterious emergence of strange airborne particles—called "Ours"—that react to living beings' interactions, emotions, and intentions. As the phenomenon intensifies, new species and supernatural abilities appear, and a prophecy warns that Ours may one day consume the world. Players follow a close-knit group of friends who care little for labels and focus on simple, shared happiness as they search for a way to understand or stop Ours before it’s too late.

## Lore / Story Summary
A small group of friends live happily and simply, unconcerned with gender or conventional labels. One day they notice strange particles drifting through the air—familiar yet alien. They name them "Ours."

Ours appear whenever living beings interact, but not every interaction produces the same kind of Ours. The particle type depends on the action, the emotional tone, and the mental state of those involved. Over time, the phenomenon grows stronger: new uncanny creatures and species form, and some individuals develop supernatural powers fueled by Ours.

A seer—empowered by Ours—warns that these particles may eventually consume and destroy the world. Faced with that prophecy, the friends set out to investigate Ours' origin and mechanisms. The player's choices determine whether Ours becomes a force of destruction, transformation, or something wholly unexpected.

Themes: friendship, responsibility, consequences of interaction, and diverse human experiences.

## Gameplay Overview
- Branching narrative driven by player choices and relationships.
- Mini-games are interwoven into the story and can:
  - Unlock or close narrative branches.
  - Influence which Ours types are produced.
  - Grant items, knowledge, or temporary abilities.
- Ours System (example design):
  - Emotional axes: Warmth, Anger, Longing, Emptiness, etc.
  - Action types: Trust, Betrayal, Gratitude, Violence, Compassion.
  - Interaction results produce an Ours signature (combination of emotion + action + context).
  - Certain Ours signatures can mutate environments, spawn creatures, or grant powers.
- Multiple endings depend on how players manage relationships, choices, and the handling of Ours.

## How to Run / Development Notes
This README is intentionally engine-agnostic. Tell me which engine or framework you use (Ren'Py, Unity, Godot, or custom engine) and I will add exact build/run instructions.

General steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   - git clone https://github.com/Kazuniverse/Ours.Visual-Novel.git
2. Open the project in the appropriate engine/editor:
   - Ren'Py: Open the project folder with the Ren'Py launcher and run.
   - Unity: Open the folder in Unity Editor (use the recommended Unity version).
   - Godot: Open the project file in Godot Editor.
   - Custom: Follow engine-specific docs in /docs or ask for tailored instructions.
3. Run or build the project from the editor.
4. Development workflow suggestions:
   - Create feature branches: `feature/your-feature` or `fix/short-description`.
   - Include a clear PR description and testing steps.
   - Add automated tests where feasible (unit tests for mini-game logic, integration tests for save/load).

If you specify the engine, I will update this section with exact prerequisites, required versions, and build commands.
